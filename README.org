#+SUBTITLE: An R package integrating ledger
#+AUTHOR:    J. Alexander Branham

This is a package that integrates [[http://ledger-cli.org][ledger]] into R. It's a work in progress and liable to break and change. Feel free to use github's "issues" system to ask a question.

* Functions
- =read_ledger= :: can read ledger files and return an R data.frame. You must have =ledger= installed in order to use this
- =ledger_graph= :: produces some pretty plots from ledger data
- =time_aggregate= :: helper function to aggregate ledger data

* How to install
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  devtools::install_github("jabranham/ledgerReports")
#+END_SRC
